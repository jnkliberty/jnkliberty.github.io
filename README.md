# builds

Portable, anonymized versions of projects I've built — GTM automations, AI systems, and internal tools.

Each folder is a self-contained project with its own README, architecture notes, and (where possible) runnable code.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Stack |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| [gtm-site](./projects/gtm-site/) | GTM consulting site — booking flow, lead capture, RSS content feed | Next.js, Supabase, Resend, Upstash |
| *More coming* | | |
