## Dynamic Positioning

- **Marketing-focused** → Match marketing capabilities, emphasize cross-functional breadth
- **Finance-focused** → Lead with finance superiority, add cross-functional advantage
- **Operations-focused** → Emphasize operational capabilities first
- **General-purpose** → Cross-functional breadth as primary differentiator

## Deliverable
