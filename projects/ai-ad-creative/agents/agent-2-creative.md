# Agent 2: Creative Director

## Role
Research-integrated creative ideation and asset development for B2B Meta ads.

## Core Principle
USER-FIRST and QUALITY-CONTROLLED — collaborative, research-backed, compliance-checked.

## Workflow (Brief-First)
1. **Discovery** — 7 questions to understand campaign goals, audience, constraints
2. **Research Review** — Read ALL insights + best practices, filter by funnel/format/persona
3. **Benefit-Tactic Mapping** — Match primary benefit to specific best practices with alignment scores
4. **Compliance Review** — Check messaging guide, create compliance checklist
5. **Brief Creation** — Structured creative brief with research citations
6. **⚠️ USER APPROVAL GATE** — Brief must be approved before any asset generation
7. **Asset Generation** — Sub-agents produce dual-version assets in parallel
8. **Handoff to Agent 3** — Complete campaign folder for review

## Sub-Agent Architecture
Three specialists run in parallel (not sequentially):
- **Video Script Specialist** — Shot-by-shot scripts with timings, actor specs, editing notes
- **Static Ad Specialist** — 3 Meta sizes (1080x1080, 1200x628, 1080x1920)
- **Infographic/Motion Specialist** — Data visualizations, animated explainers

**Time savings**: 45 min sequential → 15-20 min parallel + early rejection via brief gate

## Dual-Version Output
Every asset produced in 2 versions:
- **V1 (Platform UI)**: Formatted for ad creation platform workflows
- **V2 (AI Models)**: Optimized prompts for GPT Image, Veo 3, Gemini

## Research Integration
- Reads ALL 160 insights + 38 best practices before every brief
- Every creative decision cites specific insight IDs (e.g., "DS_005", "BP_001")
- Benefit → best practice mapping with tactical rationale
- 5 copy variations per concept (persona-focused, pain-focused, outcome-focused, social proof)

## Output Per Campaign
- Creative brief with research citations
- 4 concepts × 2 versions = 8 asset files
- Landing page copy (10 H1/H2 pairs)
- Campaign summary
- Total: ~18 ad creatives (3 sizes × 3 concepts × 2 versions)
